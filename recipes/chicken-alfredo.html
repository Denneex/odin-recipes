      <li>1 lb (450 g) fettuccine pasta</li>
      <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup (80 g) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley leaves, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to the package instructions, until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the heavy cream and Parmesan cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Add the cooked fettuccine to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce and toss to coat. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water to thin it out.</li>
      <li>Serve the Chicken Alfredo hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley leaves.</li>
    </ol>
