        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions, until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti and set it aside.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using), and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add the crushed tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and the flavors have melded together.</li>
